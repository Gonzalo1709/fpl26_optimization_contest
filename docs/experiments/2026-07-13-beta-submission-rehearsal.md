# Beta Submission Rehearsal

## Local archive preflight

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Branch: `feat/score-aware-optimizer-portfolio`
- Commit at audit start: `d88e8b4`
- Evaluator contract: extract an archive containing a top-level
  `fpl26_optimization_contest/`, then run `make setup` and repeated default
  `make run_optimizer DCP=...` invocations.

The existing local `upload270426.zip` was inspected read-only and is **not a
beta candidate**:

| Check | Existing archive result | Required result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Size | 1,276,956,005 bytes | Less than 4,294,967,296 bytes |
| Top-level project directory | Missing; repository files are at archive root | `fpl26_optimization_contest/` |
| `.git` metadata | Present | Excluded |
| Contest SSH private key | `fpl26contest-key.pem` present | Excluded |
| Benchmark DCPs | Present | Excluded |
| `.env` | Not found | Excluded |

Do not upload or reuse `upload270426.zip`. It contains credential material and
does not satisfy the documented extraction layout.

## Current package footprint

| Component | Measured unpacked bytes |
| --- | ---: |
| Main-repository tracked regular files | 8,843,087 |
| Current RapidWright checkout | 237,843,851 |

The clean-clone packaging approach in
`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-13-beta-submission-sprint.md` has ample room
under the 4 GiB limit. The final archive must still be built after all source
changes are committed and must be audited independently.

## Final rehearsal checklist

| Gate | Result |

The official VM rehearsal is pending authorized SSH access. No upload or
submission has been performed.
